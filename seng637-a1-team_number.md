# Introduction

This report covers Assignment 1 for SENG 637, which aims to introduce us to key software testing methodologies, including exploratory (non-scripted) testing, scripted testing, and regression testing. Another important goal was to gain hands-on experience using a defect tracking system and learning how to create clear and informative defect reports. To achieve this, we utilized a defect tracking tool to monitor and log defects identified during testing.  
  
The software under evaluation consisted of two iterations of a simulated ATM system—Version 1.0 and Version 1.1. Since access to the source code was not provided, we exclusively performed black-box testing.  
  
The assignment was a collaborative effort, requiring coordinated scheduling, remote meetings, and discussions via voice calls and text messages. Before working on this assignment, our team had theoretical knowledge of exploratory testing, manual scripted testing, and defect tracking but lacked practical experience in executing these techniques. This assignment provided an opportunity to bridge that gap and refine our understanding through direct application.  
  
As we progressed, we noticed a significant improvement in efficiency. When testing ATM Simulation Version 1.1, we completed the test cases in half the time compared to Version 1.0. The experience gained from the initial version helped streamline our process, making testing Version 1.1 much more efficient.
